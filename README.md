Block matchmaking from connecting to other people

Destiny 2, Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 are the only games supported at this moment.

## How to use it ##
This program includes a global activation key (hotkey) so you can toggle in game if you desire.

You can change the hotkey if you don't like the default one set for you, I've always found this annoying in a lot of applications. I thought it would have been very hard, but it turns out I'm really stupid.

## Language ##
This is the first program I'm dabbling in alternate languages. The way it's set up is that you can load a ".ini" from a folder in the same directory called "lang". It'll load any ".ini" files in the lang folder (try to keep the length of the name as low as possible) and you can select the language. It's my first attempt at it.

You can comment out lines / parts of lines by using 2 forward slashes "//". It won't get parsed by the program if it starts with it, and it won't parse the rest of the string if it contains them.

There's a ini file in the folder called "English.ini", it's in English and can be used as a base for translating.

Some newer stuff is not translatable, until there's more interest in this application it'll only be in English.
